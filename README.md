# US_Election_Bots
Repository for *Election-bots: A Twitter Propaganda Machine*, a research project focused on the identification and analysis of automated accounts on Twitter related to the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

## Executive Summary
While extensive efforts have been made to identify automated Twitter accounts (A.K.A bots) in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. elections, understanding the influence these accounts have on their audiences and the population remains a challenge. This analysis expands on previous efforts by examining language patterns and language coordination between bots and real users to determine the influence and effectiveness of bot content. Using modern machine learning and computational content analysis methods this research achieves three objectives: 
1.	The identification of bots in the Twitter conversations surrounding the 2020 presidential election
2.	An analysis of the content produced and amplified by these bots which discovers that automated Twitter accounts predominantly post content favorable to presidential candidate Donald Trump.
3.	The creation of a measure of discursive influence that highlights the most impactful tweets for both bots and users within a 3-hour time window.
